 CSCI 5448 Project 2

Adam Pollins

## Language
This project was developed in Python 3.7.6 64-bit ('base': conda)

## Assumptions
Assumptions carried over from the first project are that the Zoo is supposed to be a collection of animals and that felines are supposed to have an equal probability of sleeping, roaming, or making noise. It is also assumed that the felines cannot actually do anything else in their sleep. I have no other assumptions or inconsistencies with the instructions to report.

## Instructions
In the directory where the `./proj2` directory is located, simply run `python proj2`
